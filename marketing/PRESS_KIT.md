Founded in February 2026 by MC (Rakis) and operating fully remote, OnHyper serves indie developers, startups, and enterprises building the next generation of AI applications. The platform offers usage analytics, rate limiting, and a generous free tier for prototyping. With simple SDK integration and support for all major frontend frameworks, OnHyper makes secure AI integration a five-minute task rather than a multi-week infrastructure project.

## FAQ for Journalists

### What problem does OnHyper solve?

Frontend developers building AI-powered applications face a critical security issue: API keys must never be stored in browser-side code because they can be scraped and abused. Traditionally, this meant building a backend server just to protect those keys—a significant infrastructure burden for solo developers and small teams. OnHyper provides a secure API proxy that stores keys server-side, eliminating this problem and letting developers ship AI features in minutes instead of weeks.

### Who is the target user?

OnHyper targets frontend developers, indie hackers, startup teams, and enterprises who want to integrate AI APIs without managing backend infrastructure. The typical user is building a web application that calls AI services like OpenAI or Anthropic and wants security without complexity. The free tier appeals to prototypers and hobbyists, while paid plans serve professional developers and teams.

### How is this different from competitors?

Several key differentiators:

1. **Simplicity-first:** 5-minute integration with minimal code changes
2. **Multi-provider support:** Not locked into one AI provider—works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Cohere, and more
3. **Generous free tier:** 10,000 requests/month for prototyping
4. **Dev-focused:** Built by developers for developers, with clean APIs and great DX
5. **Transparent pricing:** No hidden fees, predictable monthly costs

### What's the business model?

OnHyper operates on a freemium SaaS model:
- **Free tier:** 10,000 requests/month for prototyping and hobbyists
- **Paid plans:** $19-$49/month for professional use with higher limits
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing for large organizations with SLAs and dedicated support

Revenue scales with usage—developers who build successful apps naturally upgrade to paid tiers.

### What's the company's origin story?

MC founded OnHyper in February 2026 after experiencing the pain of securely integrating AI APIs into frontend applications. The infrastructure overhead to protect API keys was disproportionate to the actual application logic being built. OnHyper was created to solve this problem once and for all, with the tagline "Where Agents Ship Code" reflecting the mission: let developers focus on shipping their AI agents and applications, not wrestling with security infrastructure.

### What's the roadmap?

Near-term priorities include:
- Additional SDK languages (Python, Go, etc.)
- More AI provider integrations
- Enhanced analytics and monitoring features
- Team collaboration features
- Self-hosted option for enterprises with compliance requirements

### Is OnHyper venture-funded?

OnHyper is currently bootstrapped. Update this section if/when funding status changes.
