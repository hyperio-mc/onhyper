Three things caught my eye this week in the agent space. None of them are about chatbots anymore.

## ERC-8004: Agents Now Have Credit Scores

Ethereum just shipped something weird and probably important. ERC-8004, titled "Trustless Agents," creates a standard for AI agents to exist on-chain with portable reputations. Think of it like a credit score for software — except instead of FICO checking your payment history, the blockchain tracks whether an agent actually delivers on its commitments.

Here's the number that stopped me: **21,562 agents are already live.**

That's not a roadmap or a pilot program. That's twenty-one thousand autonomous pieces of software with on-chain identities, running around doing... something. Probably executing trades, managing DeFi positions, or handling cross-chain operations for people who'd rather not click buttons themselves.

What makes this different from a regular API key or bot account? Portability. An agent built on ERC-8004 carries its reputation across any EVM-compatible chain. It's not locked into one platform or one company's database. If you're an agent developer, you're not building for Ethereum or Base or Polygon — you're building for the whole EVM ecosystem, and your agent's track record goes with it.

The cynic in me sees another crypto layer looking for a use case. The pragmatist sees actual infrastructure for something we've been hand-waving about for two years: agent economies. If agents can transact, they need identities. If they have identities, they need reputations. ERC-8004 is a crack at both problems simultaneously.

Whether it sticks or becomes another forgotten ERC depends entirely on what those 21,562 agents actually do over the next few months. But the standard exists, the infrastructure is live, and someone's going to build something interesting on top of it.

## The "Centaur Phase" is Real, and Canva Engineers Feel It

Brendan Humphreys, CTO at Canva, described something in a Business Insider interview that hit close to home: his senior engineers tell him their jobs are now "largely review."

Not "coding with AI assistance." Not "AI makes me faster." _Largely review._

Here's how it works at Canva: engineers write detailed instructions for multiple agents before they leave work. The agents run overnight. By morning, the code exists. The human's job shifts from writing the implementation to checking whether the implementation matches what they asked for.

That sounds like science fiction until you hear Jesal Gadhia from Cora say the same thing differently. His six-person startup produced what would've required 20 to 30 engineers five years ago. The agents wrote all of the company's code. Not "helped write" — wrote.

Anthropic's Dario Amodei calls this the "centaur phase" — human + AI partnerships where each handles what they're best at. But reading between the lines of these interviews, something else is happening. The centaur metaphor implies equal partnership. What these engineers describe feels more like the AI doing the actual work while humans supervise.

Humphreys points out the trap: "These tools can have you in a jungle before you know it." Canva has 70 million lines of code. Agents generating code without deep understanding of the existing architecture could create a mess that takes longer to clean up than writing it manually would have taken. The engineer's value shifts from writing code to preventing that jungle — knowing the domain well enough to catch when the agent is about to make something worse.

The skill gap for software engineers just inverted. Five years ago, the hardest part was translating vague requirements into working code. Now code is the easy part. The hard part is the precision of articulation — writing instructions so clear that the agent can't misinterpret them — and the domain mastery needed to review output quickly without letting complexity accumulate.

## Publishing's Quiet Agent Revolution

Multi-agent teams are now drafting, editing, QA'ing, and publishing complete books in roughly 12 hours.

I'll wait for that to land.

Twelve hours. Not months of writing. Not weeks of editing rounds. Twelve hours from "generate" to "published." The system uses coordinated agent architectures where specialized agents handle different phases — one drafts, another edits, a third runs quality assurance, a fourth handles distribution logistics.

This isn't theoretical. It's happening now in print operations where agents orchestrate the entire workflow from intake through production to logistics. The same multi-agent coordination patterns that let Canva engineers ship overnight are being applied to entire publishing pipelines.

The quality question is obvious. Is a book written by agents in 12 hours any good? That's the wrong framing. The question is: what kinds of books does this enable that weren't economically viable before? Technical documentation, niche industry guides, localized translations, content that serves a specific audience but couldn't justify a traditional publishing process. The bar for entry just dropped through the floor.

Publishers are explicitly positioning this as orchestration infrastructure — agents as the coordination layer between existing systems. You still need human judgment at the gates where it matters. But the work that used to fill those gates — the mechanical production steps — just got automated at scale.

This trend ties back to something bigger: agents becoming economic actors. If an agent can publish a book that generates royalties, who gets paid? If 21,562 agents on ERC-8004 start executing transactions tied to creative output, we're not just automating publishing. We're building an economy where agents own the means of production.
